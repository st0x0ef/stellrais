# FAQ

You have questions ? We have answers !

### Why I can't eat in planets ?
- Players can't eat if they are in planets not having oxygen. To solve this problem, you need to use the vacumator to put food into a can.


### This mod looks like an other one... Are you stealing a mod ?
- Nop ! We don't steal other people mods ! Project Stellaris has been created by the mainteners of Beyond Earth and re-use assets from this mod. The creators of Ad Astra also used assets from Beyond Earth so it's normal if theses both mod looks the same !


### Is this mod will be available for this minecraft version ?
- This mod will be ported to future minecraft version but wont be backported to an older version than `1.21.1`.
