## Get Oil
There are two ways to find oil


## Oil Finder
To get Oil, you will need to craft the oil finder.

With this item, you can right click on a block and it will tell you if there is oil in the chunk.

When you finally found oil in a chunk, you can craft the `pumpjack drill` and then you will be able to craft the `pumpjack`

::: warning
When placing the `pumpjack`, you wont be able to get the pumpjack drill ! Make sure to place in a good place
:::

When powered, the pumpjack will drain the oil in the chunk. Then, you will be able to getback the oil in buckets !

## Craft the Fuel Refinery

Now, you need to transform the oil to fuel. This is possible because of the Fuel Rafinery Block.

## Usage

If Oil is present in the first tank and if the block is powered, the oil will be transfered into Fuel.

The Slot at the right top has two function :
- When putting a bucket, the bucket will be filled with Fuel
