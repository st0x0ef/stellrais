# Oxygen

One of the most important thing for a living creature to live is Oxygen !
Without Oxygen, you die ðŸ˜¥!

Let's learn how to create oxygen !

## The Machines

To create oxygen, you first need to craft the water separator. This machines separate oxygen and the hydrogen from the water.

To automate the water, you can craft a `Water Pump` over a water source next to water separator.

:::warning
The `Water Separator` and the `Water Pump` both need to be powered

(Don't mind the broken textures)

## Use the oxygen

After that, you will be able to generate oxygen

In the left tanks, `hydrogen` is generated

In the right tank, `oxygen` is generated

To fill up an item with oxygen, you can place it under the oxygen tank. For exemple, you can fill Oxygen Tank or a Space Suit.

## Oxygenate a room

Now, you have oxygen ! You can put this oxygen in Oxygen Tank.

You can fill this tank by putting it into the slot under the oxygen tank in the water separator.

After that, you will need an ``Oxygen Distributor``

Place it in a sealed room with nothing over, and then put the oxygen tank in the middle slot !
