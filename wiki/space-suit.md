## Upgrade Station

The Space Suit is completely modulable, you can attach tons of modules to it ! 
Let see how !

First, you need an `Upgrade Station`

In the menu, you can place the `Space Suit Chest` and the module you want to add.

Now, you actually need modules.

:::warning
Modules can only be applied to the Chestplate

## Modules

There are two Tiers of Modules :

- The Tier 1 is crafted with heavy metal nugget
    ![Tier 1](/recipes/tier_1.png)

- The Tier 2 is crafted with steel nugget
    ![Tier 2](/recipes/tier_2.png)

Modules crafted with a base module of Tier 2 are better than Tier 1

**Modules already in-game**
